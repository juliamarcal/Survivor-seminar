# Epitech Pool semester 5 - Survivor seminar
## Project Overview
Survivor Seminar is a responsive and accessible web application designed to help an agency transition from their existing system to a modern dashboard. The system provides tools for managing clients, coaches, and meetings, while also enabling insightful analytics and other interactive features.

The backend implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to store and manage data fetched from an external API. Regular updates ensure synchronization between the old and new systems, facilitating a seamless transition.
